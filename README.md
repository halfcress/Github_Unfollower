# Github_Unfollower <br>
 <br>
This program is designed to detect and automatically unfollow users who do not follow you on github. <br>
 <br>
First, we will need tokens to access the GitHub API in Python. Log in to GitHub and follow these steps: <br>
 <br>
1* Click on your profile photo in the top right corner. <br>
2* Click on "Settings". <br>
3* Click on "Developer settings" in the left side menu. <br>
4* Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left side menu. <br>
5* Click on the "Generate new token" button. <br>
6* Enter a description for the token and scroll down to select the required permissions. <br>
7* Click on the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page. <br>
 <br>
The generated token will only appear once. Therefore, copy the token somewhere and keep it in a safe place. <br>
 <br>
Now you can use your token, under the main function.  <br>
