# Github_Unfollower

This program is designed to detect and automatically unfollow users who do not follow you on github.

First, we will need tokens to access the GitHub API in Python. Log in to GitHub and follow these steps:

1* Click on your profile photo in the top right corner.
2* Click on "Settings".
3* Click on "Developer settings" in the left side menu.
4* Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left side menu.
5* Click on the "Generate new token" button.
6* Enter a description for the token and scroll down to select the required permissions.
7* Click on the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.

The generated token will only appear once. Therefore, copy the token somewhere and keep it in a safe place.
